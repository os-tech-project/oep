OSTech projects should be named in the format `<letter>Tech`, where `<letter>` is decided alphabetically. The first OSTech project was named ATech (which was originally AoPSTech but was changed in order to not infinge on AoPS' trademark), so the next will be BTech. The one after that will be CTech, so on and so forth. OSTech projects can also gain 'proper' names as replacements for the barebones `<letter>Tech` names.
